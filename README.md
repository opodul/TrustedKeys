Please do not blindly trust these pieces of information.
They have been exported from the official websites and collected from my local computer. 
If there are discrepancies, it could indicate errors in my repository or the less likely scenario of a compromised version of the official website.

It's always better to have multiple sources of information, fetched either at different times or from different authorities.
